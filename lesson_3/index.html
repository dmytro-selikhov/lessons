        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="text" id="about">Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest European
          country after Russia, which borders it to the east and northeast.[b][10] It also borders Belarus to the north;
          Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and Romania and Moldova[c] to the southwest; with a coastline along
          the <mark>Black Sea</mark> and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast.[d] Kyiv is the nation's capital and
          largest city, followed by Kharkiv, Dnipro and Odesa. Ukraine's official language is Ukrainian; Russian is also
          widely spoken, especially in the east and south.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> During the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later
          became a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century.
          The state eventually disintegrated into rival regional powers and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol
          invasions of the 13th century. The area was then contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of external powers
          for the next 600 years, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire,
          and the Tsardom of Russia. <span>The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century marked
            on maps as "Ukraine, land of the Cossacks", but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and ultimately
            absorbed by the Russian Empire</span>. Ukrainian nationalism developed and, following the Russian Revolution
          in 1917, the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic was formed. The Bolsheviks consolidated control over much
          of the former empire and established the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a constituent
          republic of the Soviet Union when it was formed in 1922. In the early 1930s, millions of Ukrainians died in
          the Holodomor, a human-made famine. The German occupation during World War II in Ukraine was devastating, with
          7 million Ukrainian civilians killed, including most Ukrainian Jews.

        <p class="text colored-text">The name of Ukraine is frequently interpreted as coming from the old Slavic term
          for 'borderland' as is the word krajina.[20] Another interpretation is that the name of Ukraine means "region"
          or "country."
        </p>

        <p class="text etymology" id="etymology">In the English-speaking world during most of the 20th century, Ukraine
          (whether independent or not) was referred to as "the Ukraine".[21] This is because the word ukraina means
          'borderland'[22] so the definite article would be natural in the English language; this is similar to
          Nederlanden, which means 'low lands' and is rendered in English as "the Netherlands".[23] However, since
          Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991, this usage has become politicised and is now rarer, and style
          guides advise against its use.[24][25] US ambassador William Taylor said that using "the Ukraine" implies
          disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty.[26] The official Ukrainian position is that "the Ukraine" is both
          grammatically and politically incorrect.[27]</p>

        <p class="text">The establishment of the state of Kievan Rus' remains obscure and uncertain.[42] The state
          included much of present-day Ukraine, Belarus and the western part of European Russia.[43] According to the
          Primary Chronicle, the Rus' people initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia.[44] In 882, the pagan
          Prince Oleg (Oleh) conquered Kyiv from Askold and Dir and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'.[45]
          Anti-Normanist historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper
          River were already in the process of forming a state independently.[46] <br> The Varangian elite, including
          the ruling Rurik dynasty, later assimilated into the Slavic population.[43] Kievan Rus' was composed of
          several principalities ruled by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes ("princes"), who often fought each other for
          possession of Kyiv.[47]</p>

        <div class="text-selector">
          During the 10th and 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in
          Europe, a period known as its Golden Age.[48] It began with the reign of Vladimir the Great (980–1015), who
          introduced Christianity. During the reign of his son, Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the
          zenith of its cultural development and military power.[43] The state soon fragmented as the relative
          importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of Vladimir II Monomakh
          (1113–1125) and his son Mstislav (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities
          following Mstislav's death, though ownership of Kyiv would still carry great prestige for decades.[49] In
          the
          11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the Turkic-speaking Cumans and Kipchaks was the dominant
          force in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea.[50]
        </div>

        <p class="text">The Mongol invasions in the mid-13th century devastated Kievan Rus'; following the Siege of Kyiv
          in 1240, the city was destroyed by the Mongols.[51] In the western territories, the principalities of Halych
          and Volhynia had arisen earlier, and were merged to form the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia.[52] Daniel of
          Galicia, son of Roman the Great, re-united much of south-western Rus', including Volhynia, Galicia, as well as
          Kyiv.</p>

        <p class="text-p">He was subsequently crowned by a papal envoy as the first king of Galicia–Volhynia (also
          known
          as the
          Kingdom of Ruthenia) in 1253.[53]</p>

        <p class="text">
          Ukraine is among the world's top agricultural producers and exporters and is often described as the "bread
          basket of Europe". <span>During the 2020/21 international wheat marketing season (July–June)</span>, it ranked
          as the sixth
          largest wheat exporter, accounting for nine percent of world wheat trade.[256] The country is also a major
          global exporter of maize, barley and rapeseed. <span class="crimson-color">
            global exporter of maize, barley and rapeseed. In 2020/21, it accounted for 12 percent of global trade in
            maize and barley and for 14 percent of world rapeseed exports.
            global exporter of maize, barley and rapeseed. </span> Its trade share is even greater in the
          sunflower oil sector, with the country accounting for about 50 percent of <span class="crimson-example">world
            exports</span> in 2020/2021.[256]
        </p>

        <p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" target="_blank"
            title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> of the United Nations (FAO),
          further to causing the loss
          of lives and increasing humanitarian needs, the likely disruptions caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War to
          Ukraine's grain and oilseed sectors, could jeopardize the food security of many countries, especially those
          that are highly dependent on Ukraine and Russia for their food and fertilizer imports.[257] Several of these
          countries fall into the Least Developed Country (LDC) group, while many others belong to the group of
          Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs).[258][259] For example Eritrea sourced 47 percent of its wheat
          imports in 2021 from Ukraine. Overall, more than 30 nations depend on Ukraine and the Russian Federation for
          over 30 percent of their wheat import needs, many of them in North Africa and Western and Central Asia.[256]
